# MIPSProcessor-AlteraFPGA
MIPS Processor design and implementation for an Altera (intel) Cyclone V board. Provide own config file for board. Synthesizes and currently outputs fibonacci numbers on the board, but can run any MIPS instructions.


Split up into the different stages of a MIPS Processor, into Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory, and Write-Back. Also has a section for the main control unit.
